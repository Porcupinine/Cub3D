# **Cub3D**

### Overall
This was the second group project at Codam, and it aims the creation of a 3D 
looking labyrinth inspired by the game Wolfenstein 3D. 
During this project we worked with the [MLX42 library](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42)
to emulate a 3D environment using Raycasting.

### Download and usage
You can [download](https://github.com/Porcupinine/Cub3D/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
the zip version of the project or clone it using the terminal.
you can run the program with:
```console
./cub3d maps/valid_maps/"map_of_your_choice"
```
or you can create your own map, but it must follow some rules.
